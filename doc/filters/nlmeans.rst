===============

Non-Local Means is a denoising filter that computes filtered pixel values as a weighted average of pixels in the spatial neighborhood, where the weights are determined as a function of color distance.

Example::

   from geo.filters import nlmeans
   ds_filtered = nlmeans(ds, r={'lat': 3, 'lon': 3, 'time': 1},
                         sigma=1, h=1, f=1)
